        Welcome to the 2017 MUSTANG GT, the culmination of a century of automotive changing tastes and market requirements. And sure, while the Model T which Ford was referring to, was available in many styles and colours, including black, for years buyers have had to choose from a pretty basic staple of shapes and sizes that manufacturers have to offer. But now, with modern scalable platform development a veritable technical art form, we can have pretty much what we want up top, as everything underneath has been well and truly tried and tested. The 3GT is a poster child for this freedom. And for a platform that underpinned the ‘ultimate driving machine’ mantra for years, the 3 Series Gran Turismo is a strange beast.</p>
